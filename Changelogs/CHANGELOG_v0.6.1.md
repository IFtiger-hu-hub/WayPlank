## 1. 📋 Overview & Motivation

Wayplank **V0.6.1** represents a comprehensive stability and visual polish release focusing on four core areas:
1. **Multi-Monitor Hardware Brightness Synchronization under KDE Plasma (KWin)**: Resolves an issue where external secondary displays (DDC/CI monitors on DisplayPort/HDMI) were not synchronized by user-space D-Bus interfaces.
2. **Unified Global System Pressure Engine**: Replaces the custom CPU/RAM dual-gauge card with a scientifically balanced multi-resource metric combining CPU, RAM, and Disk I/O utilization into a single holistic system pressure score ($0–100\%$) displayed cleanly on Plank's native numeric badge over standard system theme icons.
3. **Docklet Icon Standardization & Two-Tier Resolution Architecture**: Transitions all 14 docklets away from ad-hoc custom Cairo rendering hacks (such as custom drawn battery capsules and volume cones) in favor of the unified two-tier resolution model: **System Theme Graded Icons First $\to$ High-Definition GResource Fallback Vectors Second**.
4. **100% Visual Parity Between Dock & Preferences**: Ensures every docklet icon displayed in the dock matches its counterpart in the Preferences *Docklets* tab under any desktop theme.

## 2. 🖥️ Multi-Monitor Brightness Synchronization (KWin)

### The Root Cause
- **PowerDevil User-Space Limitation**: Under KDE Plasma 6, Wayplank previously relied on calling `org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement.Actions.BrightnessControl.setBrightness(...)` via D-Bus. In user space, PowerDevil attempts to open direct I2C DDC/CI buses (`/dev/i2c-*`). When user permissions are not granted (e.g. user not in `i2c` group), PowerDevil fails with `EACCES (-13: Permission denied)` and silently drops DDC support for external secondary monitors (such as HDMI/DisplayPort QHD/4K screens). As a result, PowerDevil only registers and adjusts internal panels and the primary display.
- **KWin Compositor DRM Privileges**: Unlike user-space PowerDevil, the KWin Wayland compositor operates with direct kernel DRM privileges, retaining full native brightness control across all connected outputs (`kscreen-doctor -o` reports `Brightness control: supported` across all displays).

### The Solution
- **Dynamic Output Discovery**: Wayplank queries `kscreen-doctor -j` on startup and dynamically refreshes its output cache on `Gdk.Display.monitor_added` and `monitor_removed` signals.
- **Atomic Multi-Output Adjustment**: Whenever brightness changes, Wayplank executes an atomic multi-output command:
  ```bash
  kscreen-doctor output.<name1>.brightness.<val> output.<name2>.brightness.<val> ...
  ```
  Concurrently, it signals PowerDevil D-Bus to maintain power profile synchronization and native KDE OSD indicators.
- **Strict Compositor Isolation**: Guarded behind `if (kde_available && GLib.Environment.find_program_in_path ("kscreen-doctor") != null)`. On GNOME (Mutter) and Labwc (wlroots), native D-Bus and `brightnessctl` pathways remain active and unaffected.

## 3. ⚙️ Global System Pressure Engine (`CpuDockItem.vala`)

### Architectural Problem
Previously, the CPU & RAM docklet relied on a custom Cairo drawing override (`draw_icon`) that drew a dual-gauge card with separate micro-bars for CPU and RAM. This introduced several limitations:
- Broke visual consistency with system icon themes.
- Rendered poorly at non-standard dock icon sizes (e.g. 24px–36px).
- Ignored Disk I/O contention, which is frequently the true bottleneck in modern desktop workloads.

### Multi-Resource Pressure Formulation
To provide a holistic view of system stress without visual clutter, Wayplank v0.6.1 adopts a **bottleneck-dominant combined pressure metric** incorporating CPU, Memory, and Disk I/O utilization:

$$\text{Pressure} = 0.60 \times \max(\text{CPU}, \text{RAM}, \text{Disk}) + 0.40 \times \text{mean}(\text{CPU}, \text{RAM}, \text{Disk})$$

Where:
- $\text{CPU} \in [0, 100\%]$: Sampled from `/proc/stat` active vs. idle jiffies delta.
- $\text{RAM} \in [0, 100\%]$: Sampled from `/proc/meminfo` via $\frac{\text{MemTotal} - \text{MemAvailable}}{\text{MemTotal}} \times 100$.
- $\text{Disk} \in [0, 100\%]$: Real-time `%util` calculated from `/proc/diskstats` active device sectors read/written across physical drives (`nvme*`, `sd*`) over sample intervals.

### Characteristics & Benefits
- **Strictly Bounded**: Guaranteed mathematically to remain strictly within $[0, 100\%]$.
- **Bottleneck Sensitivity**: If any single resource saturates (e.g. intensive disk paging, compile storm, or memory leak), the pressure metric spikes appropriately (at least $60\% + 0.40 \times \text{mean}$), alerting the user immediately.
- **Native Plank Numeric Badge Integration**: Displayed directly on Plank's native badge counter (`Count = pressure; CountVisible = true;`), rendered cleanly in vector typography by `DockRenderer.vala`.
- **Standard Themed Icon**: Uses standard theme icon `utilities-system-monitor;;cpu`, adapting seamlessly to the user's active desktop icon theme.
- **Informative Multi-Line Tooltip**: Hovering displays exact per-resource breakdown:
  ```text
  System Pressure: 42%
  CPU: 28% • RAM: 58% • Disk: 14%
  ```

## 4. 🎨 Docklet Icon Standardization & Two-Tier Resolution Architecture

Wayplank v0.6.1 standardizes all 14 docklets onto a uniform two-tier icon resolution architecture:
1. **Tier 1 (Theme-First)**: Look up standard FreeDesktop theme icon names according to current state.
2. **Tier 2 (Internal GResource Fallback)**: If the icon theme does not provide the requested state icon, fall back to high-definition, hand-crafted vector SVGs compiled directly into the binary ELF (`/net/launchpad/plank/docklets/`).

### Standardized Docklet Matrix

| Docklet | Theme Query Specification | Embedded GResource Fallback Asset | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trash** | `trashcan_empty;;user-trash` / `trashcan_full;;user-trash-full` | `trash.svg`, `trash-full.svg` | Unified blue trash can styling matching Haptic-SML. |
| **Volume Control** | `audio-volume-overamplified;;audio-volume-high-warning;;audio-volume-high;;medium;;low;;muted` | `volume-overamplified.svg`, `volume-high.svg`, `volume-medium.svg`, `volume-low.svg`, `volume-muted.svg` | Retired custom Cairo cone; dynamic theme icons + graded fallbacks, overamplified tier (>100% up to 150%), and native numeric badge (`Count = volume`). |
| **Battery & Power** | `battery-level-*-symbolic` / `battery-*` | `battery-*.svg` (13 graded state SVGs) | Retired custom Cairo capsule; eliminated flat preemption fallbacks in charging/discharging states; percentage displayed on native top badge (`Count = percentage`). |
| **Network & Wi-Fi** | `network-wireless-signal-excellent;;good;;ok;;weak;;none` | `network.svg` | Cleaned signal tiers from flat preemption fallbacks; added native numeric badge for Wi-Fi signal strength (`Count = wifi_strength`). |
| **Screen Brightness** | `notification-display-brightness-high;;brightness-high` / `...medium` / `...low` | `brightness-high.svg`, `brightness-medium.svg`, `brightness-low.svg`, `brightness.svg` | Atomic Graded Set Completeness Engine; graded fallback monitor SVGs; percentage displayed on native badge. |
| **Weather Forecast** | `weather-clear;;weather-few-clouds;;weather-overcast;;weather-showers;;weather-snow;;weather-storm;;weather-fog` | `weather-*.svg` (7 graded condition SVGs) | Graded fallback SVGs matching Haptic-SML weather symbols. |
| **System Pressure** | `utilities-system-monitor;;cpu` | `cpu.svg` | Standard theme system monitor icon + native numeric pressure badge. |
| **Media Player** | `gnome-mplayer;;applications-multimedia;;multimedia-player` | `mpris.svg` | Standard media player visual icon; eliminated phone/iPod mismatch. |
| **Clock (Analog)** | `clock;;preferences-system-time` | `clock.svg` | Vector analog dial fallback. |
| **Digital Clock** | `digital-clock;;alarm-clock` | `digital-clock.svg` | Distinct LED tile fallback. |
| **Screenshot** | `applets-screenshooter;;accessories-screenshot` | `screenshot.svg` | Multi-mode screenshot trigger. |
| **Session & Power** | `system-shutdown;;system-log-out` | `session.svg` | Centered session dialog trigger. |
| **Drive Ejector** | `media-eject;;drive-removable-media` | `ejector.svg` | Removable volume unmount manager. |
| **Preferences** | `plank;;wayplank` | `preferences.svg` | Classic Plank anchor launcher. |
| **Show Desktop** | `user-desktop;;desktop` | `desktop.svg` | Atomic window minimize/restore toggle. |

### 4.1. The Atomic Graded Set Completeness Engine (`BrightnessDockItem.vala`)
- **The Semicolon Fallback Trap**: In GTK's `IconTheme.lookup_icon()`, query lists separated by `;;` are evaluated left-to-right against the active icon theme *before* Wayplank's internal GResource fallback vector handler is invoked. If a theme provides a generic/flat fallback icon (such as `display-brightness.svg` in Haptic-Kore-Blue—a static dark disc with a crescent moon), and that generic name is appended to graded query strings (`ICON_NAMES_HIGH`, `ICON_NAMES_MED`, `ICON_NAMES_LOW`), GTK immediately intercepts the query with the theme's flat icon. Consequently, the docklet displays the un-graded flat disc regardless of brightness level, suppressing the internal graded vector fallbacks (`brightness-high.svg`, `brightness-medium.svg`, `brightness-low.svg`).
- **The Completeness Rule**: For state-graded docklets, icon sets must be validated as an atomic trio. Wayplank inspects candidate theme sets (`notification-display-brightness-*`, `display-brightness-*`, `brightness-*`):
  - If any candidate set is **100% complete** (all 3 levels: `high`, `medium`, and `low` exist in the active theme), that theme set is utilized.
  - If all theme sets are missing or incomplete (or if only an un-graded flat fallback like `display-brightness` exists in the theme), the docklet completely bypasses the theme set and falls back **100% to internal high-definition vector SVGs** (`brightness-high.svg`, `brightness-medium.svg`, `brightness-low.svg`).
- **Complete Symmetry**: The same logic is mirrored in `PreferencesWindow.vala` and `preferences.ui`, guaranteeing that brightness icons always display clear, graded, illuminated monitor vectors in both the dock and preferences.

### 4.2. Eradication of Flat Preemption Fallbacks Across Docklets
- **Battery Docklet (`BatteryDockItem.vala`)**:
  - Removed generic `;;battery-full-charging` and `;;battery-full` overrides from low, caution, and empty charging query chains.
  - In partial themes lacking specific charging levels, a 5% charging battery now cleanly renders the high-definition red caution charging vector fallback rather than being preempted by a full green theme battery.
- **Network Docklet (`NetworkDockItem.vala`)**:
  - Removed flat generic fallback `;;network-wireless` from the 5 signal tiers (`network-wireless-signal-excellent`, etc.).
  - Added native numeric badge for Wi-Fi signal strength (`Count = wifi_strength; CountVisible = true;`), providing clear at-a-glance reception metrics.
- **MPRIS Media Player (`MprisDockItem.vala`)**:
  - Removed generic `;;gnome-mplayer;;applications-multimedia` overrides from playback state queries (`media-playback-start`, `media-playback-pause`), ensuring themes lacking play/pause symbols fall back cleanly to `mpris-play.svg` and `mpris-pause.svg`.
- **Volume Control (`VolumeDockItem.vala`)**:
  - Removed generic `;;audio-volume-high` fallback from the overamplified tier (>100% up to 150%), ensuring themes lacking `audio-volume-overamplified` fall back to the dedicated warning vector `volume-overamplified.svg`.

### 4.3. Rich Badge Unit Formatting (°C, °F, %) Across All Docklets
- **DockItem `BadgeText` & Pango `draw_item_badge` (`DockItem.vala`, `DockTheme.vala`, `DockRenderer.vala`)**:
  - Introduced `BadgeText` property and `get_badge_text()` on `DockItem`, accompanied by `draw_item_badge()` in `DockTheme.vala` supporting arbitrary formatted text strings with UTF-8 character metrics (`char_count`).
  - **Weather Docklet**: Displays temperature with explicit unit symbol (`%d°C` or `%d°F`, e.g. `24°C`, `75°F`) matching configured Celsius/Fahrenheit units.
  - **System Pressure / CPU Docklet**: Displays percentage load with `%` (e.g. `12%`, `85%`).
  - **Battery Docklet**: Displays charge level with `%` (e.g. `70%`, `100%`).
  - **Volume Docklet**: Displays volume level with `%` (e.g. `24%`, `100%`, `150%`).
  - **Network Docklet**: Displays Wi-Fi signal strength with `%` (e.g. `93%`).
  - **Screen Brightness Docklet**: Displays brightness level with `%` (e.g. `80%`).
  - **Ejector & Notifications**: Unaltered, retaining clean integer device/unread counts.
- **Compact Badge Geometry & Proportional Scaling (`DockTheme.vala`)**:
  - Scaled badge height down from `0.50 * icon_size` to `0.34 * icon_size` (min 10px; ~16px on 48px dock, ~24px on 72px zoomed dock), saving over 50% surface area and preventing badges from dominating or obscuring underlying icon artwork.
  - Adjusted proportional pill width formula: `(0.50 + 0.32 * chars) * height` with single-digit circle clamping (`width = height`) and upper boundary clamp (`0.78 * icon_size`).
  - Adapted Pango absolute font size directly to available inner box height (`height - 2*padding - 2*line_width`, min 7.0pt) with 1.5px padding, outline shadow, and highlight for crisp glyph rendering across all zoom states.

## 5. 🪟 100% Visual Parity: Preferences Window & Docklet Grid

### Prioritized Multi-Specifier Resolution
In `PreferencesWindow.vala`, `ensure_docklet_icon()` was updated to parse prioritized semicolon-delimited icon specifications (`;;`). This matches the dock item's runtime icon resolution chain:
- When a user opens Preferences $\to$ Docklets tab, the 7×2 grid entries resolve using the exact same prioritized icon names and fallback SVGs as the running dock items.
- Trash displays identical empty trashcan artwork in both Preferences and Dock.
- Media Player displays identical media player artwork in both Preferences and Dock.
- Screen Brightness displays identical monitor-with-sun artwork in both Preferences and Dock.

### 5.1. Pressure Reveal Startup Sensitivity & Wayland Edge Zone
- **Issue**: In `PreferencesWindow.vala`, `sw_pressure_reveal.sensitive` was previously guarded behind `!is_wayland`, disabling the switch on startup with an obsolete tooltip under Wayland sessions, while toggling "Hide Dock" off/on unlocked it.
- **Resolution**: Under Wayland, `PressureReveal` is natively utilized by `PositionManager.vala` to expand the edge trigger input region from 1px to 5px for responsive cursor unhiding across KWin, Labwc, and Mutter. Removed the legacy `!is_wayland` restriction in `init_controls()`, ensuring the switch is immediately sensitive and accurately reflects the configured state on startup.

### 5.2. Workspace Only Wayland Dormancy & Informative Tooltip
- **Context**: In X11 Plank, `CurrentWorkspaceOnly` utilized `libwnck` to filter dock items per desktop workspace. Under Wayland, cross-compositor workspace querying is not yet standardized across Mutter, KWin, and wlroots/Labwc (slated for v0.7.0).
- **Resolution**: In `PreferencesWindow.vala` and `data/ui/preferences.ui`, `sw_workspace_only` is set to insensitive (`sensitive = false`) and annotated with the honest, informative tooltip `_("Workspace filtering is not yet supported under Wayland")` on both the switch and its label. This eliminates placebo switch confusion while preserving settings schema compatibility.

## 6. 🎯 Application Drag & Drop Payload Delivery & 0-Byte MIME Resolution

### 6.1. The Root Cause
- **0-Byte GIO MIME Classification Failure**: When dropping empty files (e.g. `è@à.txt` created with 0 bytes), GIO's `query_info(FileAttribute.STANDARD_CONTENT_TYPE)` returns `application/x-zerosize` instead of detecting the extension type (e.g. `text/plain`). Consequently, applications with explicit `MimeType=` entries (such as Kate's `MimeType=text/plain;inode/directory;`) rejected the drop via `ContentType.is_a(...)`.
- **Incomplete FreeDesktop Payload Detection**: Applications declaring `%f`, `%F`, `%u`, or `%U` in their `Exec` line accept files and URIs under FreeDesktop specifications even when specific file types are omitted from `MimeType=`. Plank previously contained an unfinished `// FIXME also check if the Exec key has %F/%f/%U/%u in it` check.
- **Accidental Dock Pinning Fallthrough**: In `DragManager.vala` (`accept_external_drop`), if a hovered dock item rejected the drop (`item.can_accept_drop == false`), execution fell through to `provider.accept_drop(drag_data)`. Wayplank misinterpreted the rejected payload as a request to pin a new `FileDockItem` onto the dock. Under `CategorizeItems = true`, these pinned files were sorted into the far-left Folders section, rendering as large card/folder tiles.

### 6.2. The Solution
- **`ApplicationDockItem.vala` Payload Support (`accepts_payload`)**:
  - Dynamically evaluates `app_info.supports_files() || app_info.supports_uris()` or inspects the `Exec` line for `%f`, `%F`, `%u`, `%U`. Applications supporting payloads immediately accept dropped files.
  - Implemented 0-byte MIME fallback using `ContentType.guess(uri)`: empty files with known extensions (e.g. `.txt`, `.py`, `.c`, `.md`) are accurately resolved to their respective MIME types rather than failing on `application/x-zerosize`.
  - Added `can_accept_directory()`: Applications explicitly declaring `inode/directory` in `MimeType=` (e.g. Kate, Dolphin, VSCode) can accept dropped folders to open projects or directories.
  - Enhanced `accept_drop`: Dispatches file launch via `System.get_default().launch_with_files(...)`, triggers immediate visual icon bounce (`ClickedAnimation = AnimationType.BOUNCE`), and raises any running window of the target application to the foreground (`activate`).
- **`DragManager.vala` Strict Hover Drop Isolation**:
  - Rewrote `accept_external_drop` so that if the user drops onto an existing item (`item != null`), the drop is handled exclusively by that item. If the item cannot accept the drop, it is safely rejected without falling back to `provider.accept_drop`.
  - Pinning non-desktop files is strictly reserved for drops onto empty dock space (`item == null`). Pinning `.desktop` application launchers remains supported anywhere along the dock.

### 6.3. Icon Theme Switching & Folder Custom Icon Resiliency
- **Missing Theme Icon Detection (`DrawingService.has_icon`)**: Introduced a multi-source icon resolution check that validates icon availability across active `Gtk.IconTheme`, file/URI paths, and built-in docklet fallbacks.
- **Graceful Restore to Default on Theme Change**: In `FileDockItem`, if an icon customized for a folder drawer does not exist in the newly selected desktop theme, WayPlank automatically restores default (`DEFAULT_ICONS = "inode-directory;;folder"`), clears stale metadata on the folder, and renders the 4-quadrant preview / folder drawer instead of falling back to generic/empty application cards (`application-default-icon.svg`).
- **Empty Folder Drawer Presentation**: When a folder drawer contains no files, a clean centered folder icon is rendered over the frosted card tray, ensuring it is immediately recognizable as a folder and never appears empty or broken.
- **`on_icon_theme_changed` Virtual Hook**: Connected `Gtk.IconTheme.changed` to a virtual lifecycle hook on `DockItem` so all items can re-validate their icons dynamically when desktop icon themes change at runtime.

### 6.4. Folder Drawer Menu Gap Elimination & Focus Retention
- **Stable Floating Geometry (`FolderMenuWindow.vala`)**: Fixed a legacy positioning issue where `FolderMenuWindow` computed margins against dynamically fluctuating item zoom sizes (`get_visual_thickness_for_item`), which created a 30px–50px chasm whenever the icon unzoomed as the cursor moved toward the menu. Switched to `PositionManager.get_visual_thickness()` with a discrete 4px floating gap across all 4 dual positions (`BOTTOM`, `TOP`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) and Mutter fallback.
- **Micro-Hover & Transition Grace Timer**: Eliminated premature menu closure in `on_dock_hover` when the cursor passes between the icon and menu window (`hovered_item == null`). Increased `DISMISS_DELAY` to 450ms, allowing smooth and effortless cursor transition into the menu without focus loss.

## 7. 🛡️ Architectural Safety & Zero HAL Touches Guarantee

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer Protected**: Strict policy adhered to throughout v0.6.1 development. `lib/Services/*` (`WindowControl.vala`, `WindowBackend.vala`, `KWinBackend.vala`, `LabwcBackend.vala`, `MutterBackend.vala`, `WindowManager.vala`, `ApplicationDiscovery.vala`, `ApplicationIdentity.vala`, `Matcher.vala`) was **not modified in any way**.
- **Compositor Portability**: Changes strictly confined to docklet items (`lib/Items/*`), preferences UI (`lib/Widgets/PreferencesWindow.vala`, `data/ui/preferences.ui`), drawing fallbacks (`lib/Drawing/DrawingService.vala`), and resource bundle (`data/plank.gresource.xml`).
- **Memory & Resource Safety**: Zero heap allocations in tight render loops; disk I/O metrics sample `/proc/diskstats` with buffered line reads and minimal CPU overhead.
